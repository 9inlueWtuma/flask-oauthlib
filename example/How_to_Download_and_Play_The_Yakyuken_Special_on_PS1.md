# How to Download and Play The Yakyuken Special on PS1
 
The Yakyuken Special is a Japanese game for the PlayStation 1 (PS1) that involves playing rock-paper-scissors against various models. If you win, they will strip off their clothes until they are fully naked. The game was released only in Japan and is very rare and hard to find. However, you can still download and play it on your PC using an emulator and an ISO file.

An emulator is a software that mimics the functions of a console, allowing you to run games that are not compatible with your system. An ISO file is a disc image that contains all the data of a game. You will need both of these to play The Yakyuken Special on your PC.
 
Here are the steps to download and play The Yakyuken Special on PS1:
 
1. Download a PS1 emulator. There are many options available, such as ePSXe, PCSX-Reloaded, or RetroArch. You can find them on various websites, such as [Emulator Zone](https://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/psx/) or [EmuParadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/Sony_Playstation_Emulators/Windows/2). Make sure to download the emulator that is compatible with your operating system and follow the instructions to install it.
2. Download the BIOS file for the PS1 emulator. The BIOS file is a firmware that allows the emulator to run the games. You can find it on the same websites as the emulator or on other sites, such as [Gamulator](https://www.gamulator.com/bios/psx-bios) or [RomsMania](https://romsmania.cc/bios/psx-playstation-bios-scph1001-bin-2). Make sure to download the BIOS file that matches your emulator and region. For example, if you are using ePSXe and you live in Europe, you will need the SCPH-1002 BIOS file.
3. Extract the BIOS file and place it in the BIOS folder of your emulator. You will need a software that can extract ZIP or RAR files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can find the BIOS folder in the same directory as your emulator. For example, if you installed ePSXe in C:\Program Files\ePSXe, you will find the BIOS folder in C:\Program Files\ePSXe\bios.
4. Configure your emulator settings. Open your emulator and go to the configuration menu. You will need to select the BIOS file that you downloaded and placed in the BIOS folder. You will also need to configure other settings, such as video, audio, input, and plugins. You can find more information on how to configure your emulator on its official website or on online forums.
5. Download The Yakyuken Special ISO file. You can find it on various websites that offer PS1 ROMs or ISOs, such as [CoolROM](https://www.coolrom.com.au/roms/psx/40276/Yakyuken_Special_Konya_Ha_12_Kaisen_%28J%29.php) or [Rom Hustler](https://romhustler.org/rom/psx/yakyuken-special-konya-ha-12-kaisen-j). Make sure to download the ISO file that matches your region and language. For example, if you live in Japan and speak Japanese, you will need the Yakyuken Special Konya Ha 12 Kaisen (J) ISO file.
6. Extract the ISO file and place it in the ISO folder of your emulator. You will need a software that can extract ZIP or RAR files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can find the ISO folder in the same directory as your emulator. For example, if you installed ePSXe in C:\Program Files\ePSXe, you will find the ISO folder in C:\Program Files\ePSXe\iso.
7. Run The Yakyuken Special on your emulator. Open your 0f148eb4a0
